* Want to print a paper like this? Here are steps to print a paper as a booklet

- Rearrange the PDF :: In order to make your PDF read like a book, you
     need to rearrange the order of the pages before you print it. I
     wrote a python script to do this. Get the code from this github
     repository: https://github.com/chongchonghe/booklet-creator.git
     and following the guide there.

- Print the PDF in Tabloid style :: Print the PDF in Tabloid style (11
     by 17 in, or 279 by 432 mm). A printer setup on macOS looks like
     this:

- Fold and staple it :: In order to put staples in the middle of the
     booklet, you may need a stapler longer than usual. I have left a
     long stapler of mine on the desk in this office for everyone to
     use. Set the scale at 8.5 in.
